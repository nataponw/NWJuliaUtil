# NWJuliaUtil

Kleine aber feine Collection of useful functions

# TODO for the next development
- [x] Use the convention that constants are written in uppercase letters
    - Change `_plotly_layout` to `_FMT_LAYOUT`
- [ ] `plothistogram`
    - Overload the function to accept a dataframe and vector
    - Move the `showlegend` detection up
    - All traces are in the same `bingroup`.
- [ ] `plotbar`
    - Compare with the python counterpart
- [ ] `merge_dfs`
    - Change the default input object to dataframe instead of vector pair. This is better because keys must be unique!
